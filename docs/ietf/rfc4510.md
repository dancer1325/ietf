# Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Technical Specification Road Map

* Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) 
  * ðŸ‘€:= internet protocol -- for accessing -- distributed directory services / follow X.500 data + service models ðŸ‘€
    * ðŸ‘€extensible protocol ðŸ‘€ 
    * == X.500 access mechanism
* LDAP server
  * -- MUST act in accordance with -- X.500 (1993) series of International Telecommunication Union -
       Telecommunication Standardization (ITU-T)
  * However, it is not required that an LDAP
       server make use of any X.500 protocols in providing this service.
       For example, LDAP can be mapped onto any other directory system so
       long as the X.500 data and service models [X.501][X.511], as used in
       LDAP, are not violated in the LDAP interface.
