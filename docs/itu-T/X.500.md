* goal
  * facilitate the interconnection of information processing systems 
    * == -- provide -- directory services 
  * concepts of
    * Directory
    * DIB (Directory Information Base)

* Directory
  * == information processing systems + directory information | previous systems
    * frequency of "queries" >> frequency of updates
      * Reason: üß†works -- as -- communication directory üß† 
      * frequency of updates -- is governed by the -- dynamics of people & organizations
    * results of directory queries -- are INDEPENDENT on the -- identity or inquirer's location
  * == directory capabilities -- required by -- MANY application layer standards & telecommunication services
    * "user-friendly naming" capabilities
      * == objects -- can be referred to, by -- names 
      * OPTIONAL
    * "name-to-address mapping" capabilities
      * allows
        * objects -- are bound to their -- locations
          * == dynamic
          * -> networks are "self-configuring"
            * == if you add OR remove OR change the object location -> NOT affect network operation
  * goal
    * | Open Systems Interconnection, allows,
      * interconnecting information processing systems /
        * | DIFFERENT
          * manufacturers
          * managements
        * DIFFERENT
          * levels of complexity
          * ages
    * ‚ùåNOT general-purpose database system ‚ùå 
  * uses
    * define the abstract service -- provided by the -- Directory
    * specify the protocols -- through which, you can obtain OR propagate, the -- service
  * use cases
    * NOT valid for some types of routing
      * Reason: üß†results of directory queries -- are INDEPENDENT on the -- identity or inquirer's location üß†
* Directory Information Base (DIB)
  * == information | Directory
  * uses
    * facilitate communication -- between -- objects (_Example:_ application entities, people, terminals and distribution lists)
